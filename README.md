This repo contains html, css and a js file along with the images associated with the game 

Description:
the project started off as a cooking based tic tac toe game, but late in the construction phase, I could not get the design to really match the intended look, so I stripped the html and css back and went with a new theme of carnival whack a mole.

Logic:
The logic the the game is all contained in the javascript, started off with some basic drawings of flow diagrams to work out the basic structure of the game 

It came down to a couple simple steps in which to then execute into code
- set up 
- make a move 
- check for winner 
- switch turn if no winner 

From these steps the game was built out.
